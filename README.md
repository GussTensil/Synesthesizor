The Synesthesizor is a multimodal research tool, focused on synesthetic and artistic aesthetics.
This Github contains the data and files that will allow you to test the first prototype of the synesthesizor.

The first version of the Synesthesizor prototype consists of two patches for theses softwares. To use the Synesthesizor, make sure to download the two files. Plug a midi controller into your computer, then launch the two file on MaxMSP and TouchDesigner. Make sure to activate the audio process in MaxMSP, and that the time player on TouchDesigner is on. Playing midi note on your midi keyboard will trigger MaxMSP, which will send info to TouchDesigner, then graphical data will appear on the TouchDesigner interface.
